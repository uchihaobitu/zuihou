Official code of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01140) Root Cause Analysis In Microservice Using Neural Granger Causal Discovery . 

## Introduction
We propose a novel approach for root cause analysis using neural Granger causal discovery with contrastive learning.

* Enhance the backbone encoder by integrating contextual information from time series
* Leverage a time series forecasting model to conduct neural Granger causal discovery
* In addition, we incorporate Pagerank with a personalization vector to efficiently recommend the top-k root causes

## Reproduce RUN
```
python main.py --root_path ./ --data_path data --root_cause root_cause
```
